# alpha_beta-tree
the input is 1.the tree' dregree
             2.the tree' level
             3.the leaf's data
             
and the output is 1.the leaf's total counts
                  2.the node's total counts
                  3.the root's value
                  4.how many node this algorithm,alpha-beta, will not visited
